## YOLOV11 
Based on this repository : https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics

This part contains the code and the data to run the YOLOv11 model on our data.
The file requirements.txt is not created yet.
Make sure to change path names on your code.

### To improve
  - Create a file requirements.txt
  - Run it : You have to use a GPU (quite efficient as the model can take a lot of time) otherwise, execute it on collab. (It was too long for me)
  - Debug and improve the code
  - Add performance metrics
  - Clean the code once it is good
