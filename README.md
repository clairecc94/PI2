## YOLOV11 
Based on this repository : https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics

This part contains the code and the data to run the YOLOv11 model on our data.
The file requirements.txt is not created yet.
Make sure to change path names on your code.

### To improve
  - Create a file requirements.txt
  - Run it : You have to use a GPU (quite efficient as the model can take a lot of time) otherwise, execute it on collab. (It was too long for me)
  - Debug and improve the code
  - Add performance metrics
  - Clean the code once it is good

## Cloud-Detection-in-sky-images
Based on this repository : [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics](https://github.com/yuhao-nie/Cloud-dection-in-sky-images) Make sure to check the readme and the code there first
This part contains the code and the data to run another model on our data.
Change the image number to test different detections.
The end of the code is on their data not ours.

### To improve
  - The code runs well for the cloud detection but not for the sun detection (it detects the sun as a cloud)
  - Do the video visualization as in the initial code
  - Debug and improve the code
  - Clean the code once it is good
